# Phase 2: Biome Life Modelling

At planetary surfaces different biomes will be derived based on intersection of temperature and humidity.

Colonised by flora and fauna - maximum energy within the system cannot exceed the output from the star within the same time period.

Genome for plants to be designed
Genome for animals to be designed

All genetic modifications require an energy cost to maintain
Modifications based on animal success over evolution time period feeding into genetic algorithm (eg number of different mutation strains from a single species)

Animals exist on a sliding scale of herbivore to carnivore to allow for omnivores and nuance of preference within that class.
Ability to eat plants/animals linked to genetics, eg unable to eat plants without molars or hunt effectively without canines.

Individuality within a species provided by traits system.
Inherited, random and gained with experience.
Levels of traits dependent on key attributes and in some cases combinations, eg strength, intelligence

Require two timelines, one to govern at thousands of years level to model evolution
One to govern at species lifetime level to model predator/prey cycles.

Animal behaviour will be governed by a states system - to be derived via machine learning based on sensory input
1. Hunger/Energy Levels
2. Season
3. Day/Night cycle
4. Location of other animals (same species/other - no threat/predator)
5. Location of food
6. Traits (eg Insanity)

Detection driven by sense and displayed as cones of attention
1. Sight
2. Hearing
3. Smell
4. Taste
5. Electrical sensitivity
6. Psychic ability

Perturbed by stochastic effect to model imperfect decision making
